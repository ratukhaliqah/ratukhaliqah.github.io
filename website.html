	<h3>Online Learning Experiences</h3>
	

	<p>	It has been approximately a year since our first day of online school. A lot of things have changed since then. To me, online learning has its own difficulties. It was kind of stressful but it didn't really show. Because the oen draining was our mental health instead of physical health. But I don't need to worry about anything now. I learned to enjoy life at it is, at the very moment. I have friends who I can always count on, and they can count on me. Online learning feels fun, since I don't really have to go out and go to school. It is now my comfort zone.</p>
	

	<p>	Since I spent all of my time at home, I had more free time. I learned about a few things. I tried to learn a new language, I can understand a few phrases in Japanese and write words in Hiragana. I bought canvas and tried to paint, I even taught my siblings to paint skies. I learned to animate, I post some of my artwork to my social media platforms. I learned how to play guitar and ukulele, sometimes my siblings and I sing along together in my room. And there was a time where I learned to bake cakes and I made puddings. My family liked them so I decided to sell them. Unfortunately no one was willing to buy my puddings due to the delivery fee. Though at first it was kind of difficult, I think online learning is fun and I enjoyed it.
